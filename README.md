# Reddit Video Downloader
I want to get into Ruby programming so I've decided to start with a simple project to solve a real problem I had.

**Backstory:** I wanted to share a meme I saw on Reddit's PrequelMemes subreddit. [This one](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/fp280f/this_is_my_magnum_opus_my_creme_de_la_creme/). Reddit does not make it easy to simply download and share a video file. I would prefer to share an actual file instead of a link to Reddit, whose website and mobile client is now incredibly poor in my experience. My Reddit client of choice, Apollo, provided this awesome functionality: direct video sharing. The app would export the video to a file when you attempted to share the post. If I recall correctly, the behavior was configurable in the app preferences. Ever since that app went defunct in 2023, I've stopped using Reddit. However, I knew there were a few high quality memes on there that I wanted to save and share. Therefore, I set out to put something together and practice using Ruby.

This is an incredibly naive implementation because I just wanted to get something working. I plan to build it out a bit more so I can use more features/libraries in Ruby. There is more to come!
